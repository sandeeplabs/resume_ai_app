# 🧠 AI Resume Tailor API

An AI-powered FastAPI backend that **reads resumes**, **matches them to job descriptions**, and **suggests tailored improvements** to increase relevance for a specific role.

> ⚠️ This project provides **advisory insights only**. It does **not guarantee interviews or job offers**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📄 Upload resumes (PDF / DOCX)
* 🧩 Parse and extract resume content
* 🎯 Match resumes against job descriptions
* 🤖 AI-powered tailoring suggestions
* 📊 Resume–job relevance scoring (advisory)
* 🔌 Modular architecture (CRUD + AI separated)
* 🧪 API-first design (Swagger UI included)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project uses a **modular layered architecture** optimized for fast MVP development while remaining scalable for future growth.

```
Routes (FastAPI)
   ↓
Services (Business Logic)
   ↓
Utils / AI Modules
   ↓
Models (Schemas / DB)
```

✔ Not full Clean Architecture (yet)
✔ Not microservices (by design)
✔ AI logic is **decoupled** from CRUD
